### Task A
Implemented as a PySide2 GUI client with model / video loading and separate server process for model inference. After loading an inference model and a video file, use the arrow buttons to scrub through video frames. The program will automatically send the current frame for inference, and overlay the heatmap result.

### Task A Instructions:
- ```python ./client.py```

The server process will automatically be started / shutdown by the client.

- Model->Load Model File

The interface will indicate which model is loaded in the bottom right-hand corner.

- File->Open Video File

Use the arrow buttons to scrub through video frames.

### Task B
Not implemented currently.
